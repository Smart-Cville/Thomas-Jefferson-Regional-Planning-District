# Problem
RideShare, a program of the Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission, works to reduce traffic congestion and increase mobility among in our region.

# Team Challenge
Buils a solution to increase awareness of RideShare and reduce the friction involved in participation in ride sharing programs.

# Background
Planning District Commissions (PDCs) were established by the General Assembly under the Virginia Area Development Act (Code of Virginia, Title 15. 1, Ch. 34). The Thomas Jefferson PDC (10) was formed in 1972 to provide a forum for discussion of issues localities have in common, or on which there is disagreement; to work to decrease fragmentation in government; to plan cooperatively for the future; and to provide planning services to local governments as requested. As a public body, the TJPDC strives to include the public in decision-making.

The Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission periodically engages in a strategic planning effort to prioritize its activities in a manner that is consistent with its mission. This strategic plan identifies goals and objectives that guide the development of the TJPDC’s work plan and budget. The current document is intended to serve as the TJPDC’s Strategic Plan for FY 2015‐18

RideShare is a program of the Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission in cooperation with the Central Shenandoah Planning District Commission, working to reduce traffic congestion and increase mobility throughout Central Virginia and the Central Shenandoah Valley.

We offer free carpool and SchoolPool matching, vanpool coordination, and operate a Guaranteed Ride Home program to provide free rides home in an emergency.

RideShare also works with employers to develop and implement traffic reduction programs, and we market the region’s Park and Ride lots.
